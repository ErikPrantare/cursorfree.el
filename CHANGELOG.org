- Add temporary highlighting of acted upon target.
- Expose ~cursorfree-to-action~ and ~cursorfree-to-modifier~ for
  creating custom actions and modifiers.
- Fix bugs in "inside" and "outside" commands.
- Integrate multiple-cursors for actions where it makes sense.
- Add modifiers:
  - "leftline": Select everything to the left of the target on the
    same line.
  - "rightline": Select everything to the right of the target on the
    same line.
  - "block": Select the paragraph containing the target.
  - "link": Select the URI containing the target.
  - "everything": Add a target spanning the full buffer.
  - "row": Consumes a number, and adds the line with that number as a
    target.
  - "this": Add a target starting and ending at point.  Useful in
    conjunction with other modifiers, for example "this line chuck" to
    remove the line at point.
  - "extend": Extend the first target uttered to the right until it is
    at least as far as the end of the second target.  For example,
    "this this block extend" will create a target from point until the
    end of the paragraph at point.
  - "every instance": Puts every occurrence of a target string on the
    value stack.
- Add actions:
  - "flash": Temporarily highlight a given target.  Useful for testing
    new modifiers.
  - "help": Display local help, e.g. as provided by flymake.
  - "drink" and "pour": Begin a new line before or after the target.
  - "join": Join a target of multiple lines into one.
  - "pull": Replace the first target with the second.
- Copying strings now does not copy properties.  Previously, this
  caused issues when copying readonly parts of the buffer.
