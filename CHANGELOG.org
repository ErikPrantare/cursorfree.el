- Actions:

  - New instruction "unwrap": Remove surrounding parentheses and
    quotes.
  - "pick" now pushes buttons.
  - "bring" can bring to multiple places, or to point if none are given.
  - "move" can bring to multiple places, or to point if none are given.
  - "pull" has been removed, as a "bring" can now be used in its place.

  - All modifiers now default to using "this" as the target when none
    are given.
  - Rename "extend" to "right".
  - New instruction "dupe": Duplicates the top target on the stack.

* 0.1.1 [2025-02-25 Tue]
- Add temporary highlighting of acted upon target.
- Expose ~cursorfree-make-action~ and ~cursorfree-make-modifier~ for
  creating custom actions and modifiers.
- Fix bugs in "inside" and "outside" commands.
- Integrate multiple-cursors for actions where it makes sense.
  For example, "<a> <b> change" will invoke "change" on targets <a>
  and <b>.
- Add modifiers:
  - "leftline": Select everything to the left of the target on the
    same line.
  - "rightline": Select everything to the right of the target on the
    same line.
  - "word": Select the word at the beginning of target.
  - "block": Select the paragraph at the beginning of target.
  - "link": Select the URI at the beginning of target.
  - "everything": Add a target spanning the full buffer.
  - "row": Consumes a number, and adds the line with that number as a
    target.
  - "this": Add a target starting and ending at point.  Useful in
    conjunction with other modifiers, for example "this line chuck" to
    remove the line at point.
  - "extend": Extend the first target uttered to the right until it is
    at least as far as the end of the second target.  For example,
    "this this block extend" will create a target from point until the
    end of the paragraph at point.
  - "every instance": Puts every occurrence of a target string on the
    value stack.
- Add actions:
  - "flash": Temporarily highlight a given target.  Useful for testing
    new modifiers.
  - "help": Display local help, e.g. as provided by flymake.
  - "drink" and "pour": Begin a new line before or after the target.
  - "join": Join a target of multiple lines into one.
  - "pull": Replace the first target with the second.
  - "occur": Run ~occur~ to find all instances of target.
- Copying strings now does not copy properties.  Previously, this
  caused issues when copying readonly parts of the buffer.

* 0.1.0 [2025-01-23 Thu]
- Fix issues causing the package not to function.
- Add "line" modifier.
