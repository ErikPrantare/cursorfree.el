* TODO Create a terminology header in README.

* TODO Integrate with multiple-cursors.

* TODO Commands:
- block: Properly select paragraph in all modes.  Currently does not
  always work in org-mode.
- filler: Implicitly act upon "block".

* TODO Make target a cl-struct
This is to force the usage of marks for all target bounds.

* TODO Stratify the abstraction levels
For example, I have now implemented the kill ring as a viable target.
This only works if everything goes through the functions properly
handling this.

* TODO Set up a better test "framework"
Take inspiration from the cursorless project.
- Test recorder:
  - Need to record
    - Buffer content before
    - Buffer content after
    - Point
    - Regions of the hat targets used
    - Which modifiers/actions were used
  - I could probably get away with recording the utterance used for
    each instruction.  This would also keep the test closer to what
    the user would say.
  - I want the tests to run with the changed buffer current and not.

* TODO Default value for "every instance"
** TODO "token" modifier

* TODO cursorfree-this: Potentially return multiple (e.g. for multiple cursors)
This is probably simplest if we generalize targets, so they can be
lists as well.
