* TODO Create a terminology header in README.

* TODO Integrate with multiple-cursors.

* TODO Commands:
- block: Properly select paragraph in all modes.  Currently does not
  always work in org-mode.
- filler: Implicitly act upon "block".

* TODO Make target a cl-struct
This is to force the usage of marks for all target bounds.

* TODO Stratify the abstraction levels
For example, I have now implemented the kill ring as a viable target.
This only works if everything goes through the functions properly
handling this.

* TODO Set up a better test "framework"
Take inspiration from the cursorless project.
